# FloppyFish
Flappy Bird adaptation... but it's a fish!

I decided to build a game called Floppy Fish for my final project in my Java Programming class. It's a spinoff of Flappy Bird, except it's a floppy fish. Instead of gravity doing its thing by pulling the bird down, instead, the fish floats. This means that pressing the space bar helps the fish dive/swim deeper.

The goal of the game is to go through as many pipes as possible. There are 5 levels. You level up by successfully going through 10 pipes. Each level,
the pipes move faster/the fish swims faster. If a pipe is hit, then you'll the fish dies, and you'll need to start over at 0, but the high score is kept on the top right (current score can be found on bottom left). If the surface of the water or the bottom-most part of the ocean floor is hit, then the fish dies.

Music and underwater sounds should accompany the game (if everything goes accordingly). I created, using pixelArt, what's supposed to be a little red fish. However, my artistic abilities are not that good, so the fish looks a little funky. I changed the background to show an underwater landscape, but I kept the pipes true to the original Flappy Bird.

If I had more time, I'd add more sound effects as well as fancier level changes to the game.

The final project called for building off an existing game and existing code. I modified the code from granttitus (https://github.com/granttitus/FlappyBird) and added my additional features.

Hope you enjoy Floppy Fish! :)
